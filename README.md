Set of R code files for the simulation of Weddell seal populations under 324 scenarios of toothfish depletion (3 rates) + starting toothfish encounter rates (fish/day - 2 rates) +
probability of diving success (catching silverfish in a dive, 2 probabilities) + predation release effects of toothfish on mean abundance of silverfish (3 levels of effects) +
daily diving limits (3 limits) + target mass recovery percent (3 targets). Code files also include functios used to re-create several key graphs and tables presented as results of 
this study.

These code files are supplementary materials for the paper tentatively titled:
COPING WITH LOSS OF LARGE, ENERGY-DENSE PREY: A POTENTIAL ENERGY BOTTLENECK FOR WEDDELL SEALS IN THE SOUTHERN ROSS SEA
Leo Salas, Nadav Nur, David Ainley, Jennifer Burns, Jay Rotella, and Grant Ballard
